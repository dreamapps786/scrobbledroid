 Pre-beta essential:
Check on system startup whether there is a saved queue. If there is then start a scrobble immediately.

 Pre-beta nice:
Links to sign-up page and profile page.
Static helper methods that simplify sending broadcasts for other players.
Add information to the UI about when scrobbling will take place.
Add time of last scrobble to UI.
Highlight the important user messages (BANNED, BADAUTH, BADTIME) with color.

 Pre-release:
Add copyright/license notices where necessary.
Make an icon.
Add notifications for important handshake failures that require user action (BANNED, BADAUTH, BADTIME).

 Would be nice:
Love/ban/skip.
Replace magic strings with constants so that they can be refactored easily.
Make it so that when scrobbling is disabled we still keep track of what's going, but just don't enqueue.
