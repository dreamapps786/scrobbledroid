 Pre-beta essential:
Check on system startup whether there is a saved queue. If there is then start a scrobble immediately.

 Pre-beta nice:
Highlight the important user messages (BANNED, BADAUTH, BADTIME) with color.

 Pre-release:
Update checking.
Add copyright/license notices where necessary.
Make an icon.
Add notifications for important handshake failures that require user action (BANNED, BADAUTH, BADTIME).

 Would be nice:
Add time of last scrobble to UI.
Love/ban/skip.
Replace magic strings with constants so that they can be refactored easily.
Make it so that when scrobbling is disabled we still keep track of what's going, but just don't enqueue.
Check UI with QVGA resolution.
